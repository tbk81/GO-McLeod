/*
● create a type SQUARE
	○ length float64
	○ width float64
● create a type CIRCLE
	○ radius float64
● attach a method to each that calculates AREA and returns it
	○ circle area= π r 2
		■ math.Pi
		■ math.Pow
	○ square area = L * W
● create a type SHAPE that defines an interface as anything that has the AREA method
● create a func INFO which takes type shape and then prints the area
● create a value of type square
● create a value of type circle
● use func info to print the area of square
● use func info to print the area of circle
